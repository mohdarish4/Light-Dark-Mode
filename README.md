<h1>Light-Dark-Mode</h1>

Light-Dark Mode is a feature on websites or applications that allows users to choose between two different color schemes: a light theme and a dark theme. The light theme typically has a white or light-colored background, while the dark theme has a dark background. It's a small but impactful design choice that acknowledges and accommodates the diverse preferences and needs of users.
